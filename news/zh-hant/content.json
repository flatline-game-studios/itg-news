This update brings an entirely new mechanic we’ve been designing for some time and that is part of the core game loop we’ve always had in mind. We feel Collapsing Clusters, which will be explained further down, are the right level of immersion we want for Into The Grid and a powerful tool that will afford us more control over the map exploration.\n\n- The Flatline Team",
